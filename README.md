 The article highlights
the significance of accurate and timely classification of lung
diseases, particularly in the current scenario where the world is
grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic . Early and accurate
diagnosis of lung diseases can play a crucial role in the
management and treatment of the patients, reducing the burden
on the healthcare system. The authors propose a combination of
recurrent approach and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
to improve the accuracy of the classification. In this work were
described 3 different CNN models with accuracy on test set
86%, 84% and 83% respectively . The study also compares the
performance of CNN with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
DenseNet, achieving an accuracy of 90% and 92% respectively.
To tackle the issue of overfitting, the authors used an Adam
optimizer and used training parameters in the training data
to make it consistent. The proposed approach shows promising
results in accurately classifying lung diseases and could be
a valuable contribution to the field of medical imaging.It is
important to note that different models have their own strengths
and weaknesses and the best model for a particular problem
depends on the specifics of the problem, such as the size and
complexity of the dataset, computational resources, desired
accuracy, etc
